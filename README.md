# Recursion Assignment

Recursion and Tail Recursion Implementation in Factorial.

## What is Recursion? 

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

## Implementation

In this assignment, I have made factorial program using recursion and tail recursion.

## Commands

### Compile code

```bash
  sbt compile
```

### Execute main class

```bash
  sbt run
```

### Delete all generated files

```bash
  sbt clean
```

### Generate scalastyle config file

```bash
  sbt scalastyleGenerateConfig
```

### Execute scalastyle plugin

```bash
  sbt scalastyle
```
